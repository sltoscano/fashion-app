[1:28:19 PM] Steve: Yo
[1:28:27 PM] Robert: sup
[1:28:53 PM] Steve: I have an idea for the clothing app
[1:29:03 PM] Robert: oh yea? whats that?
[1:29:29 PM] Steve: I think it would be dope to use your advanced query builder to allow users to search for outfits
[1:30:07 PM] Robert: I see, so that users can store their queries
[1:30:13 PM] Robert: and we can scrub against them daily or something
[1:30:16 PM] Steve: I.e. Dress under $100 in the what's new section, style = bohemian
[1:30:26 PM] Steve: Hell yes
[1:30:33 PM] Robert: thats cool
[1:30:34 PM] Steve: It would be fat
[1:31:11 PM] Steve: Since it only took me a few hours to scrub all of one store's data I can make scripts for a bunch of other stores
[1:31:35 PM] Steve: Then we will have a repository of data in one common format
[1:32:18 PM] Steve: Users will love the ability to do pinpoint searches across many clothing stores
[1:32:29 PM] Robert: yea that would be cool
[1:32:36 PM] Steve: Much better than a generic goggle search
[1:32:50 PM] Robert: Well thats a little different
[1:32:54 PM] Robert: you can store queries from google
[1:33:04 PM] Robert: i.e. store the url that your search generated
[1:33:20 PM] Robert: you could just keep running that
[1:34:10 PM] Steve: What I mean is - users can search the metadata that I scrub, goggle just does plain text searches
[1:34:26 PM] Robert: you can search metadata with google
[1:35:37 PM] Steve: I mean the metadata that I created: ie colors, sizes, styles, type, fabric, brand, etc
[1:36:25 PM] Robert: yea thats cool
[1:36:55 PM] Steve: The search results will be actual products that satisfy the query
[1:38:29 PM] Steve: Then later as a v2 we can make payment integrated, so you can just say - buy it, then items that the user put in their cart will all be purchased trough each vendor website
[1:39:04 PM] Robert: oo, thats tough
[1:39:18 PM] Steve: Yea but it's what mint does right?
[1:39:30 PM] Robert: you would be liable for any problems that happen during purchase, even if the problem originates on the retailers website
[1:39:33 PM] Robert: no, thats not what mint does
[1:40:06 PM] Robert: mint provides you with a description of the product, and a link to go to the third-party's site
[1:40:16 PM] Steve: Not exactly what it does, but it is similar to logging into a secure site on your behalf
[1:40:18 PM] Robert: you click the link, and the third-party handles the rest
[1:41:07 PM] Steve: But you still need to give mint your login credentials for each financial institution right?
[1:41:32 PM] Robert: yes, but there's a reason we don't allow you to transfer money from mint
[1:41:41 PM] Robert: i.e. mint only has "read" priviledges
[1:41:44 PM] Robert: not "write"
[1:41:52 PM] Steve: Ah ok that makes sense
[1:43:27 PM] Robert: I would just have a link that let them go to whatever site is selling it
[1:43:42 PM] Robert: that would reduce a lot of the work we would have to do
[1:43:50 PM] Robert: e-commerce, security, etc
[1:45:07 PM] Steve: Yea true
[1:45:40 PM] Steve: The app then is just a search engine
[1:45:57 PM] Robert: well you could add features like
[1:46:01 PM] Robert: sharing your results
[1:46:05 PM] Robert: saving favorites
[1:46:12 PM] Robert: continuosly running queries
[1:46:14 PM] Robert: getting alerts
[1:46:21 PM] Steve: Right, dope
[1:48:05 PM] Steve: Nisha tells me a lot of the clothing sites allow you to do these kinds of queries and get alerts when your item is available, but noone does it across many clothing stores
[1:49:31 PM] Robert: sounds about right
[1:49:52 PM] Steve: But first I need to get legal counsil
[1:50:05 PM] Robert: about the publishing someone else's data?
[1:50:32 PM] Steve: I don't know if scrubbing these sites and using the data I find to make money
[1:50:40 PM] Steve: Is legal
[1:50:59 PM] Robert: im sure its analogous to what Google does
[1:51:45 PM] Steve: True
[1:53:07 PM] Steve: Coo Ima do some research we heading out to a bday party, talk to ya Lara
[1:53:14 PM] Robert: aiight late
